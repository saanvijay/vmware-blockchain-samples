# Privacy admin DAPP 
The admin-dapp is a Nodejs based application that demonstrates the workflow of a privacy application's administrators.
The administrator is responsible for:

- Deploying an instance of privacy and public smart contracts and effectively the privacy application. The users rely on these smart contract addresses to get bootstrapped! 

- Since the administrator is the contract owner he can mint public ERC20 tokens to any users based on their EOA ethereum address.

- The administrator can allocate privacy budgets for any number of users, based on their privacy user identifier (PID). 

# Workflow
## Deploy the privacy application (all smart contracts)

Attach to the container:
```sh
 kubectl exec -it privacy-admin-dapp-0 -c privacy-admin-dapp -- bash
 ```

Deploy the privacy application and check the application information.

```sh

## Create budget

## Mint public balance
Note the address for Alice is a public ethereum address. For this testing it can be inferred from Alice's logs or the show command.
```sh
 node privacy-admin-dapp.js mint-public 0x45159Aef48d2337bAedd83a76a764e869073BBa7 1000
