# Ethereum Authentication - supporting mTLS and server TLS for EthRPC
This feature offers three distinct capabilities - which can be combined depending on the user goals. These capabilities are:
- Security for Server authentication - Provides assurances to the application that the end-point is indeed that of VMBC, and that the public key is indeed that of the VMBC EthRPC server.
- Security for Data in Transit - Mechanism to secure communication between the application and the EthRPC server via encrypting data in flight.
- Read permissioning - Mechanism for the blockchain administrators to decide who has read access to the blockchain, via issuing certificates or JWT Tokens to applications/users.

By default, both security mechanisms and read permissioning is turned off.

For more details about this feature, refer to this [main feature page](../../../permissioning/README.md)

## Terminology
DApp - Decentralized Application
TLS - Transport Layer Security
mTLS/mutualTLS - Mutual TLS
serverTLS - server TLS
CA - Certificate Authority
JWT - JSON Web Token
JWK - JSON Web Key
JWKS - JSON Web Key Set

## User feature
- VMBC Client nodes can be of two different characteristics/modes. These modes are differentiated based on whether the validation of incoming traffic from outside client is done based off server side TLS only or mTLS established.
  - serverTLS mode
    This mode requires server side verification only.
  - mutualTLS mode
    This mode requires server and client side verification.

- An added feature is JWT Token verification. Apart from the above two modes, a client of either mode above may or may not have JWT Token verification. JWT token verification is applicable to both - serverTLS mode and mutualTLS mode. JWT Token verification can be of two types.
  - Verification using external live authorization server
  - Verification using local public key
  
## Deployment
- Generate helm charts using the [k8s orchestrator tool](./../helm-chart).\
See [sample deployment descriptor](./sample-descriptors/deployment.json). The clients can be described as either type as mentioned in the descriptor. This file contains few of the notable combinations. For more details on the parameters and valid combinations, refer to [this section](../../../permissioning/README.md#generating-new-helm-charts).
- Install blockchain
```
helm install <name of blockchain> . --set global.imageCredentials.registry=<registry address> --set global.imageCredentials.username=<username> --set global.imageCredentials.password=<password>
```

### Helm chart details
For the clients that are configured with TLS settings, generated Values.yaml would have TLS settings section.\
example:
```
...
## TLS and TokenAuth settings for clients.
clientTlsAndTokenAuthSettings:
  client3:
    type: mutualTLS|serverTLS (Case sensitive)
    clientRootCaCert: |
      <Certificate content>
    serverCert: |
      <Certificate content>
    serverPrivateKeySecret: <Kubernetes Secret For Private Key>
    tokenAuthentication:
      publicJwks: <JWKS Content>
      issuerUri: <Issuer URI>
      issuerCaCert: ''
  client5:
    type: serverTLS|mutualTLS
    clientRootCaCert: |
        <Certificate content>
    serverCert: |
        <Certificate content>
    serverPrivateKeySecret: <Kubernetes Secret For Private Key>
    tokenAuthentication:
      publicJwks: <JWKS Content>
      issuerUri: <Issuer URI>
      issuerCaCert: |
        <Issuer CA Certificate content>
```      
During deployment of blockchain, you may also edit "clientTlsAndTokenAuthSettings" section in Values.yaml to match with Client TLS configuration.

Note: If the charts were generated with no TLS settings, then Values.yaml file would not have clientTlsAndTokenAuthSettings section.

### Validations
Please see the below conditions if you choose to use the feature "tlsAndTokenAuthSettings", under which chart generation will be restricted.
- "type" is mandatory. Valid values for "type" is either "serverTLS" or "mutualTLS".
- "serverCert" and "serverPrivateKeySecret" is mandatory.
- If "type" is "mutualTLS" then "clientRootCaCert" is mandatory else it is not required.
- If "type" is "serverTLS" then "tokenAuthentication" block is mandatory else it is optional.
- If "publicJwks" is provided then "issuerUri" and "issuerCaCert" are not required.
- If "issuerUri" is provided then "publicJwks" is not required. Either "issuerUri" or "publicJwks" is required.
- If "issuerUri" starts with "http://" then "issuerCaCert" is not required but if it starts with "https://" then "issuerCaCert" is optional.
- Validity of certificates for "serverCert" and "clientRootCaCert" and "issuerCaCert" is checked. Validity of key for "serverPrivateKeySecret" is not checked as it uses pre-applied secret name.
